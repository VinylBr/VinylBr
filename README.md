### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Welcome!! 

I am doing my PhD @ IIT Bombay, in the intersection of Chemical Engineering and Evolutionary Biology, on tackling drug-resistance evolution in tuberculosis treatment. 
Alma mater: NIT Tiruchirappalli/Trichy. I am passionate about using mathematical modeling and statistical principles to solve real-world challenges. 

Skills: Explainable mathematical models, data science, data visualization, and statistics

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on deploying a project to help clinicians predict evolutionary trajectory in response to a dosing regimen
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and implementing machine learning models

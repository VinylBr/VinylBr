### Hi there 👋, Welcome!! 

I am doing my PhD @ IIT Bombay, in the intersection of Chemical Engineering and Evolutionary Biology, on tackling drug-resistance evolution in tuberculosis treatment🔬. 
Alma mater📚: NIT Tiruchirappalli/Trichy. I am passionate about using mathematical modeling and statistical principles to solve real-world challenges. 

**Skills**: Explainable mathematical models🖥️, data science💹, data visualization, and statistics📊

- 🔭 I’m working on deploying a project to help clinicians predict evolutionary trajectory of _M. tuberculosis_ in response to a bedaquiline dosing regimen
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and implementing machine learning models
